# workdayscheduler

## Description

The goal for this project was to create an application that can be used as a work day
planner. There are timeslots for a regular 9 to 5 job, each slot changes color depending on whether or not the time is past, present or future. You can enter text on the textareas adjacent to the times, and save the entries into local storage. Even if the page is refreshed, it will still hold values until local storage is cleared or it is overwritten with another entry.
